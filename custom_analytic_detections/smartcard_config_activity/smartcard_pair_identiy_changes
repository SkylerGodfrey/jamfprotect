# smartcard_pair_identity_changes

# This Custom Analytic may be used to report on smartcards being paired/unpaired to a user account on the host endpoint.
# This detection functions by monitoring the ctkbind process in macOS when a user runs /usr/sbin/sc_auth pair -u <user> -h <hash>.

# Analytic Predicate(s):

Smartcard Identity Paired
$event.type == 1 AND $event.process.signingInfo.appid == "com.apple.ctkbind" AND $event.process.commandLine CONTAINS " -p "

Smartcard Identity Unpaired
$event.type == 1 AND $event.process.signingInfo.appid == "com.apple.ctkbind" AND $event.process.commandLine CONTAINS " -r "

# Required Analytic Configuration:

Sensor Event Type: Process Event

# Recommended Analytic Configuration:
