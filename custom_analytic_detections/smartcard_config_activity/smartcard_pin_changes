# smartcard_pin_changes
#
# This Custom Analytic may be used to report on attempts to either change or verify the pin on a smartcard on the host endpoint.
# This detection functions by monitoring the pivpin process in macOS when a user runs /usr/sbin/sc_auth changepin|verifypin.

# Analytic Predicate(s):

Smartcard Change PIN
$event.type == 1 AND
$event.process.signingInfo.appid == "com.apple.pivpin" AND NOT
(ANY $event.process.args == "-v")

Smartcard Verify PIN
$event.type == 1 AND
$event.process.signingInfo.appid == "com.apple.pivpin" AND
(ANY $event.process.args == "-v")

# Required Analytic Configuration:

Sensor Event Type: Process Event

# Recommended Analytic Configuration:

Severity: Informational
Level: 0
