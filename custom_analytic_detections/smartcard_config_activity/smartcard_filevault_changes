# smartcard_filevault_config_changes
#
# This Custom Analytic may be used to report on smartcard authentication being enabled for FileVault on the host endpoint.
# This detection functions by monitoring the ctkbind process in macOS when a user runs /usr/sbin/sc_auth filevault -o <enable|disable> -u <user> -h <hash>.
# The filevault arg enables the use of smartcards at the unified loginwindow on Apple Silicon Macs.

# Analytic Predicate(s):

Smartcard FileVault Authentication Enabled
$event.type == 1 AND $event.process.signingInfo.appid == "com.apple.ctkbind" AND $event.process.commandLine CONTAINS " -o fvenable "

Smartcard FileVault Authentication Disabled
$event.type == 1 AND $event.process.signingInfo.appid == "com.apple.ctkbind" AND $event.process.commandLine CONTAINS " -o fvdisable "

# Required Analytic Configuration:
