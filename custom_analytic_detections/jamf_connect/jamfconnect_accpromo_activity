# jamfconnect_accpromo_activity
#
# This Analytic predicate may be used to report when jamfconnect is used to programatically elevate a user to administrator and the responsible process is not Jamf signed software (Self Service as example) or it's not happening in a Terminal session with an tty assigned.
# This detection functions by monitoring for process creation involving a binary carrying the signing information of 'com.jamf.connect.tool' and process arguments containing "acc-promo --elevate".
#
# Analytic Predicate:

$event.process.signingInfo.appid == "com.jamf.connect.tool" AND
$event.type == 1 AND
$event.process.commandLine CONTAINS "acc-promo" AND
$event.process.commandLine CONTAINS "--elevate" AND
$event.process.responsible.signingInfo.teamid != "483DWKW443" AND
$event.process.tty == nil

# Required Analytic Configuration:
Sensor Event Type: Process Event
Level: 0

# Recommended Analytic Configuration:
Severity: Low
