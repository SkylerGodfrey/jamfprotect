# This Custom Analytic may be used to report on Apache (httpd) being enabled or disabled on the host endpoint.
# This detection functions by monitoring for a launchctl command executed by macOS when a user enables httpd via /usr/sbin/apachectl.

# Analytic Predicate(s):

Apache Enabled
$event.type == 1 AND $event.process.signingInfo.appid == "com.apple.xpc.launchctl" $event.process.commandLine CONTAINS[cd] " load " AND $event.process.commandLine CONTAINS[cd] "/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist"

Apache Disabled
$event.type == 1 AND $event.process.signingInfo.appid == "com.apple.xpc.launchctl" AND $event.process.commandLine CONTAINS[cd] " unload " AND $event.process.commandLine CONTAINS[cd] "/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist"
