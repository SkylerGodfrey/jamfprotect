# gatekeeper_config_changes
#
# This Custom Analytic may be used to report on changes made to Gatekeeper settings that may be considered undesirable or suspicious and in need of remediation.
# This detection functions by monitoring for usage of the spctl binary used with specific binary verbs that reduce or entirely disable the security provided by Gatekeeper.
# Verbs monitored in this custom analytic:          
# --global-disable   = disables Gatekeeper assessments entirely
# --master-disable   = disables Gatekeeper assessments entirely (older OS versions)    
# --disable          = disables one or more rules in the Gatekeeper assessment rule database
# --remove           = removes a rule(s) from the assessment rule database

# Analytic Predicate(s):

$event.type == 1 AND 
$event.process.signingInfo.appid == "com.apple.spctl" AND 
(ANY $event.process.args IN {"--global-disable", "--master-disable", "--disable", "--remove"})

# Required Analytic Configuration:

Sensor Event Type: Process Event

# Recommended Analytic Configuration:
