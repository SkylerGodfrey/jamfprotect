# filevault_config_changes
#
# This Custom Analytic may be used to report on changes made to FileVault settings that may be considered undesirable or suspicious and in need of remediation.
# This detection functions by monitoring for usage of the fdesetup binary used with specific binary verbs that reduce or entirely disable the security provided by FileVault.
# Verbs monitored in this custom analytic:          
# disable          = disables FileVault
# add              = adds additional FileVault users    
# changerecovery   = adds or updates the current recovery key
# removerecovery   = removes the current recovery key

# Analytic Predicate(s):

$event.type == 1 AND $event.process.signingInfo.appid == "com.apple.fdesetup" AND ($event.process.commandLine CONTAINS[cd] "disable" OR $event.process.commandLine CONTAINS[cd] "add" OR $event.process.commandLine CONTAINS[cd] "changerecovery" OR $event.process.commandLine CONTAINS[cd] "removerecovery")
