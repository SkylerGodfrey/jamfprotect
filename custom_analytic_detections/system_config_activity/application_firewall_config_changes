# application_firewall_config_changes
#
# This Custom Analytic may be used to report on changes made to the macOS Application Firewall settings that may be considered undesirable or suspicious and in need of remediation.
# This detection functions by monitoring for usage of the socketfilterfw binary used with specific binary verbs that reduce or entirely disable the security provided by the Application Firewall.
# Verbs monitored in this custom analytic:
# --setglobalstate off   = disables firewall entirely
# --setloggingmode off   = disables logging
# --unblockapp           = unblocks an application's connectivity through the firewall by indicated path
# --setblockall off      = disables global block all option
# --remove               = remove the application at the indicated path from the firewall

# Please note that in macOS 12 (Monterey) and above, application firewall settings enforced through a configuration profile will take precedence over changes made with the socketfilterfw binary.

# Analytic Predicate(s):

$event.type == 1 AND $event.process.signingInfo.appid == "com.apple.socketfilterfw" AND ($event.process.commandLine CONTAINS[cd] "--setglobalstate off" OR $event.process.commandLine CONTAINS[cd] "--setloggingmode off" OR $event.process.commandLine CONTAINS[cd] "--unblockapp" OR $event.process.commandLine CONTAINS[cd] "--setblockall off" OR $event.process.commandLine CONTAINS[cd] "--remove")

# Required Analytic Configuration:

Sensor Event Type: GPProcessEvent

# Recommended Analytic Configuration:

Severity: Low
Level: 0
