# root_user_enabled_or_password_changed
#
# This Custom Analytic may be used to report on the root user being enabled or the password of an already enabled root user being changed.  This Custom Analytic will detect this activity regardless of being completed via the 'dsenableroot' binary or via Directory Utility.app.
# This detection functions by monitoring for expected changes made to the /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/root.plist file when these events occur.

# Analytic Predicate(s):

$event.path == "/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/root.plist" AND
$event.isModified == 1 AND
$event.file.contentsAsDict.accountPolicyData.asPlistDict.passwordLastSetTime != $event.file.snapshotData.asPlistDict.accountPolicyData.asPlistDict.passwordLastSetTime

# Required Analytic Configuration:

Snapshot File Path: /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/root.plist
Sensor Event Type: File System Event

# Recommended Analytic Configuration:

Severity: Low
Level: 0
