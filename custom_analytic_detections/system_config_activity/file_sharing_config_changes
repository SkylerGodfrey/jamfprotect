# This Custom Analytic may be used to report on File Sharing (smbd) being enabled or disabled on the host endpoint.
# This detection functions by monitoring for a launchctl command executed by macOS when a user toggles the File Sharing feature off or on inside System Preferences > Sharing.

# Analytic Predicate(s):

$event.process.signingInfo.appid == "com.apple.xpc.launchctl" AND
$event.process.commandLine CONTAINS[cd] " load " AND
$event.process.commandLine CONTAINS[cd] "/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.smbd.plist"

File Sharing Disabled
$event.type == 1 AND
$event.process.signingInfo.appid == "com.apple.xpc.launchctl" AND
$event.process.commandLine CONTAINS[cd] " unload " AND
$event.process.commandLine CONTAINS[cd] "/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.smbd.plist"
