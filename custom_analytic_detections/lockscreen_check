# lockscreen_check
#
# This Analytic predicate may be used to report when ioreg is used to check if the macOS screen is locked.
# This detection functions by monitoring for process creation involving a binary carrying the signing information of 'com.apple.zgrep', a process group leader carrying the signing information of 'com.apple.ioreg', and a process argument containing " CGSSession".
#
# Analytic Predicate:

$event.type == 1 AND
$event.process.signingInfo.appid == "com.apple.zgrep" AND
$event.process.pgprocess.signingInfo.appid == "com.apple.ioreg" AND
$event.process.commandLine CONTAINS[cd] " CGSSession"

# Required Analytic Configuration:
Sensor Event Type: Process Event
Level: 0

# Recommended Analytic Configuration:
