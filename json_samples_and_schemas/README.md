# JSON Samples and Schemas
Jamf Protect offers the feature of [redirecting Alerts and Telemetry to third-party storage systems or a SIEM](https://learn.jamf.com/bundle/jamf-protect-documentation/page/Data_Forwarding_to_a_Third_Party_Storage_Solution.html), with the transmitted data formatted in JSON. While the [Jamf Learning Hub](https://learn.jamf.com/bundle/jamf-protect-documentation/page/Telemetry_Log_Data_Examples.html) offers sample representations for various event types, this repository is specifically curated to include examples of both Jamf Protect Alerts and Telemetry, along with the corresponding schemas pertinent to each type of event.


If you wish to send a single or multiple sample events to an HTTP endpoint, you can do so using Postman.
