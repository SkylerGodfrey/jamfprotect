# JSON Samples & Schemas
Jamf Protect offers the feature of [redirecting Alerts and Telemetry to third-party storage systems or a SIEM](https://learn.jamf.com/bundle/jamf-protect-documentation/page/Data_Forwarding_to_a_Third_Party_Storage_Solution.html), with the transmitted data formatted in JSON. While the [Jamf Learning Hub](https://learn.jamf.com/bundle/jamf-protect-documentation/page/Telemetry_Log_Data_Examples.html) offers sample representations for various event types, this repository is specifically curated to include examples of both Alerts and Telemetry, along with the corresponding schemas pertinent to each type of event.
