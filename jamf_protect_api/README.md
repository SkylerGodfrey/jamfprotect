The Jamf Protect API is the primary resource for programmatically interacting with Jamf Protect. The Jamf Protect API uses GraphQL, an advanced query service and language that allows you to search and access your data from a single endpoint.

To learn more about GraphQL, see the [Introduction to GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn) page on the GraphQL Foundation website.

Documentation on the Jamf Protect API can be found [here](https://docs.jamf.com/jamf-protect/documentation/Jamf_Protect_API.html).
