# Alerts Management

Jamf Protect supports forwarding Alerts HTTPS endpoints via the Alert Collection Endpoints feature.
This feature can then be used to generate alerts for administrators and be forwarded to 3rd party like Slack, Teams, Jira etc.

Forwarding of data requires configuration of the following:
* Configure a Jamf Protect action to forward data to an HTTP endpoint [Alert Collection Endpoint](https://docs.jamf.com/jamf-protect/documentation/Creating_an_Action_Configuration.html) inside an Action configuration.
