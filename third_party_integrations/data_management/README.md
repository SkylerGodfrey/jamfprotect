# SIEM and Data Storage Examples

Jamf Protect supports forwarding alert and other types of data to the following third-party tools:
* Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions, including but not limited to Microsoft Sentinel and Splunk
* Amazon S3

The example queries, dashboards and workbooks contained within this repository are designed to help customers begin visualising data transmitted by Jamf Protect and enable active monitoring of security events across their Mac endpoints.

Forwarding of data requires configuration of one or more of the following:
* Integrate Jamf Protect with a SIEM using an ![Alert Collection Endpoint](https://docs.jamf.com/jamf-protect/documentation/Splunk_Integration.html) inside an Action configuration
* Enable the ![Data Forwarding feature](https://docs.jamf.com/jamf-protect/documentation/Data_Forwarding_to_a_Third_Party_Storage_Solution.html)

Updated documentation for the data transmission flow coming soon.

In this repository you will find examples for:
- [ ] Microsoft Sentinel
- [ ] *Coming Soon* Splunk
