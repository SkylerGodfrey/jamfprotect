# ManualConfigurationProfileInstall
#
# This Unified Log filter may be used to report on manual installations of a configuration profile by a user.  Automatic installations, such as those from an MDM server like Jamf Pro, will not be logged.
# This filter functions by monitoring logging from the ManagedClient subsystem, mdmclient process and the MDMDaemon category and event message containing a string known to indicate a successful, manual installation of a configuration profile.
#
# Filter Predicate:

subsystem == "com.apple.ManagedClient" AND process == "mdmclient" AND category == "MDMDaemon" and eventMessage CONTAINS "Installed configuration profile:" AND eventMessage CONTAINS "Source: Manual"

# Example output for a computer-level configuration profile
