# jamf_pro_management_binary_logging
#
# This Unified Log filter may be used to report on the activity and logging of the Jamf Pro management binary on a managed Mac and is the same information sent by the binary to /var/log/jamf.log on each endpoint.
# This filter functions by monitoring logging from the jamf binary process, subsystem and with a process path that matches the valid jamf binary.

# Filter Predicate(s):

subsystem == "com.jamf.management.binary" AND process == "jamf" AND processImagePath == "/usr/local/jamf/bin/jamf"

# Example output:

Review /var/log/jamf.log from a Mac endpoint managed by Jamf Pro to see expected log entries.
