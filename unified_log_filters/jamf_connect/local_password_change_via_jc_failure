# local_password_change_via_jc_failure
#
# This Unified Log filter may be used to report on failed attempts at changing of the user's local password by Jamf Connect to sync with their cloud identity provider password.
# This filter functions by monitoring logging from the Jamf Connect process, subsystem, the category used for such events and a specific string known to indicate a failed attempt at a password change.

# Filter Predicate(s):

process == "Jamf Connect" AND subsystem == "com.jamf.connect" AND category == "OpenDirectory" AND eventMessage CONTAINS "Password change failed"

# Example output:

2021-XX-XX XX:XX:XX XX Jamf Connect[XXXX:XXXXX] [com.jamf.connect:OpenDirectory] Password change failed! Error: Credentials could not be verified, username or password is invalid.

# Additional Information:

Can be used alongside the following two unified log filters to gain logging for attempts, successes and failures of this event:

local_password_change_via_jc_attempt
local_password_change_via_jc_success
