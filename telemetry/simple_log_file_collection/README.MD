# Simple Log File Collection

In this repository, you will find examples of log file paths that Jamf Protect can collect. These logs are useful for troubleshooting or can be archived for further analysis.

Telemetry in Jamf Protect offers an optional feature to begin monitoring and collecting entries from specific simple log files as soon as telemetry is enabled. Upon activation, Jamf Protect gathers all specified log files and then continuously streams any new entries to your Security Information and Event Monitoring (SIEM) solution every minute.

**_Configured log files should adhere to the format where entries are separated by a new line._**

You can find documentation on Jamf Protect Telemetry [here](https://learn.jamf.com/en-US/bundle/jamf-protect-documentation/page/Telemetry.html).
